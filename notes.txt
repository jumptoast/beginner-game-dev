Q: How do I put things on the screen?
  A: HTML tags (aka "elements") (aka "HTML elements")

Whitespace ~ spaces, tabs, newlines (linebreak)
  ^ It's all ignored by the computer

DOM = Document (object model)

Q: How do I put things on the screen/DOM with JavaScript?
  A: document.body.append(element) <-- in our case, the element was player

^
JavaScript

  Programming language ~ it's just a lanuage ~ like english/french/spanish/chinese/etc

  Syntax = rules of the language

  ---
  core:

  ;              - end of statement
  ()             - these are for holding parameters for functions
  {}             - contains code (for resuse, most times) ~ blocks, scope
  .              - access to variables that are contained in "things" (aka objects) (Ex: document.location.origin)
  object[string] - access to a variable in an object using a string to get it
  //             - comment ~ ignored by the computer
  true/false     - truth values ~ boolean

  a = 1          - set a variable
  a == 1         - compare two values

  ---
  keywords:

  let              - variable creation ~ let a = 1;
  function         - function creation ~ function myFunction(...params) { ...body }
  if/else/else if  - conditional logic ~ if(...condition) { ...body }
  &&               - logical AND ~ "if both this and that are true"
  ||               - logial OR ~ "if either this or that is true"

  ---
  things:

  document - access to the DOM from JavaScript

Q: How to make things move?

  / Main update/refresh/render loop/tick - setInterval(function, interval)

  / Position data     - let x = 0; 

  / Update data       - x += 1;

  / Update DOM values - player.style.left = x + 'px';

---

/ Moving to local website instead of website from internet
  A: create a {{name}}.html file on your desktop and then click it

/ Objects

/ User input (starting with keyboard)

/ Basic AI

/ Collision detection

/ Multiple enemies (the static way with lots of code)

Multiple enemies (the dynamic way with loops)
